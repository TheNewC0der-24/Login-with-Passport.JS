      "An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want. To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation. Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times. Also, their are so many libraries for animation. CSS libraries are Animate.CSS, Anim XYZ, Infinite, etc. You can use any of these libraries to create your own animation. Few JavaScript libraries for animation are AniJS, ScrollReveal JS, Popmotion Pure, Lottie JS, MOJS, etc. ",
